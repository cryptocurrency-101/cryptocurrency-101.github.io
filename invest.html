            <p id="pcontent">
                First off, let us clear a few basics: If you want to invest anything in crypto, it is
                best to go for Bitcoin. Of course, there are many others available, but Bitcoin is one
                of the oldest and most trusted ones. It has been the best performing asset for the last 10 years.
                Period. Many people are still scared to move their fiat money into Bitcoin, but when you look at the
                facts and educate yourself, there is no reason at all for this scepticism.
            </p>
            <p id="pcontent">
                Most investors buy coins such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and more and wait until their
                value rise. Once their market prices rise, they sell at a profit. This investing strategy requires one
                to identify more stable and volatile assets that can shift in value rapidly, resulting in regular
                profits. Did you know that Bitcoin can be used for daily shopping, too? Yes, it also has
                many real-life applications.

                Bitcoin and crypto have value on their own, the secure and fast and relatively cheap transaction of
                money over borders. Try to send, let’s say €5.000,- from the UK to Rwanda. By bank, it will take several
                days. So you will probably use Western Union or another immigrant’s unfriendly service that charges up
                to 15%. Now try Bitcoin. It will be there, received on somebody’s wallet, in 10 minutes, the fee is a
                fraction of the 15% stolen from the poorest in the world.

                is for the ones who already know coinbase and want most advanced features and extra control

                We will be covering some pointers from the video here, although it is recommended to watch it.
                To sign up, go to <a href="coinbase.com/signup"
                    style="font-family:round;text-decoration:underline;">coinbase.com/signup</a>. After creating
                an account, you will be redirected to your dashboard. It will contain your portfolio balance,
                that shows how much money worth of crypto you have at the specific time.
            </p>
            <p id="pcontent">
                As you scroll down, you will also see a <i>watchlist</i>, which shows you the myriad of
                different cryptos you can invest in. As of now, we'll go with Bitcoin. On the panel at the
                top right corner, you will see a button called <i>trade</i>. You will then get the option
                to buy different types of crypto in different amounts by linking a credit/debit card. The
                site itself will tell you what to do next.
